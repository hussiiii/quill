Hi!

On the actual web app, click the button that says "CLICK ME" at the top to see a nicely styled ReadMe that goes over the basic idea of this take home and my approach. 

the autocomplete is a little scuffed, to try it out start typing something like "SELECT", make sure cursor is selected, and ghost autocomplete text should show. Try pressing Spacebar too if nothing shows to prompt it.
